##Pre[r]amble

Before anything else, why did I create this app?

Because I use an Android phone. And frustratingly, I needed this app, myself.

I did make it available for everyone because, why not!

I never expected it to grow to 10K downloads in less than a month; and as it happened, I released the source code. Now I'm committed to maintain and improve it as much as possible.

And what's more. It's free! It comes without ads and weighs less than 1 MB!

I really just wanted to thank everyone that took the initiative to put it out there. You’re making me work hard! :)

Let’s keep trying and make the world a better place. I know sometimes it can become challenging; but we’re all in this one together, with walls or without walls.

Please feel free to file any issues or report any bugs through here!
